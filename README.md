This Github repository contains the code and related files related to my project report.

The intent_recognition folder contains the code for this project.
The watchauth folder contains the code from the work I was extending upon (available at https://github.com/jacksturgess/watchauth). The filter.py file in this folder was used to perform the low pass filter on the dataset and was slightly altered to the desired gesture windows and destination files.

The dataset for this project is available at https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:8c7cbd89-7953-40ff-b28f-3aa3f8c59a01
